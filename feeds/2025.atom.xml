He asked me to discuss our community work and the new
Python Asia Organization (PAO) initiative, which we launched last year. I was happy to accept, as PyCon SG has been on hiatus for the past five years, and
I thought it would be a great opportunity to introduce PAO to new members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a personal connection for me to return to Singapore and speak about our future work within the community, and I touched on this at the end of my keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A collage of pictures taken during PyConSG 2025" src="https://iqbalabdullah.net/images/pycons/pycon-sg-2025-photos.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are interested, I'm placing my keynote text below. It took me 30 minutes to read through it, so your reading time should be less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something Is Missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using Python in 2002, around Ver. 1.5.2,  I didn't know anything about the community, about the Python Software Foundation (a.k.a the PSF) or about PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of building a business on top of Python, helping building our Python community, organizing PyCons and making many new friends, for the first time I attended PyCon US 2016 in Portland. I was alone at that time, knew no one, and no one knew me so I didn't get to connect to anyone else. Being an Asian introvert, it was difficult for me to go just go ahead and talk to people. I felt something was missing. Even though I had done a lot of work within the community, I didn't feel very much welcomed to this particular larger group.
I didn't know it at that time, but this experienced shaped my views on the community going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2020 the PSF had four seats vacant for its board. I reflected back on my thoughts and what I felt in 2016 to better understand what's missing. If I can figure it out, maybe there is something I can contribute to. That has always been what community involvement is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board directors of the PSF are an instrumental group of people that decides how the foundation is run and how it uses its money. They do many things for our global community, but within the context of this keynote, there are two which are particularly important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first one is The Grants Program. This has direct impact on the development of the community, because in 2023, through that program, the PSF gives out around USD600K to communities around the world to carry out their community programs. This is around 15% of the PSF's budget of USD4.5M, the third biggest expenditure behind PyCon US and staff payroll. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second one is the recognition that the PSF gives out to our community in the form of awards, such as the Community Service Awards and the Distinguished Service Awards. These awards can only be awarded with a positive vote from the PSF board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through the people who are and were board directors, and nearly all of them are people of either US or Western Europe based. Except for a few, I was not familiar with their community work and I have never met any of them in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was really strange for me. I knew many people who has contributed so many things on our side of the planet, but for some reason none of them were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was then that I realized what was missing was us!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me the mission of the Python Software Foundation? Like, the reason they exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought that there is a gap between what the PSF, as a US-centric organization thinks what it wants to do, with what it's actually doing, with what the rest of the growing community on our part of the world think that they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to run for a seat. I decided to run for a seat for four consecutive years from 2020 to 2023. I ran and urged as many people from the community from our region here to run with me. We wrote nomination statements together and supported one another. It was stressful but I had fun doing it and learned new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not get into the board, but that small thing I believed catalyzed better and bigger things. We had more people than ever from East and South East Asia running for the PSF board. Now in 2024 alone, out of the 12 board members of the PSF we have 3 people on the board that we know are involved closely in our community on our side of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diversity, Equity and Inclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the results of the 2020 board election, to its credit the PSF established the Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup and I was invited as one of its initial members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did was to find out &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; are we as a community. We talk about a "diverse and international community" but what do they look like? What languages do they speak? What do they think of the PSF? So we went around the region and did surveys to find this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, we found out that although &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;61% of people used Python for their professional work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;73% told us they do not know what the PSF does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;78% thinks that the PSF should improve their diversity and inclusion efforts within our community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;88% of them never voted in the annual PSF board elections. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% of the reasons given were that don't know they can vote, they don't know how to vote or they think it doesn't concern them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets go over two very important things when we talk about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Money and acknowledgment. Both of these directly translate to opportunities for our community to grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important because it directly correlates to the opportunities that we need to run programs and advance as a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 the PSF spent around USD200K given as grants to different communities in the world. Western Europe received 32% of this, North America received 24%. The African continent received 16%. Do you know how much the communities in the Asia region received? It was just 2%.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were shocked. I still remember it clearly: A bunch of us were at the PSF Members lunch during PyCon US 2023 in Salt Lake City sitting at a round table, and that was the first time we knew how little grants we were getting from the PSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, it's not really a fault of the PSF: They give out grants based on applications. We're not applying. Perhaps not many people knew or cared. The survey results that we took made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So within our community we pushed for more participation in the grants process by spreading the word about it and encouraging our communities to apply. In 2023 that 2% increased to 15%.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That's more opportunities for our communities to run workshops, organize meetups, and create the experiences that bring new people into our ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being recognized matters. It creates leaders and motivates people to contribute more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition is like fuel for open-source communities. When you're acknowledged, you feel part of something bigger. Others see that recognition and think, "I can do that too."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of PSF Fellows? Community Service Awards? Distinguished Service Awards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSF Fellows are nominated by peers for significant contributions. It's the highest honor in our community, and it comes with voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers tell the story:
- 435 Fellows since 2001. Only 20 from East and Southeast Asia - that's 5%
- 127 Community Service Awards since 2008. Only 10 from our region
- Distinguished Service Awards? Zero from our region&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter for Python's development? Because diverse voices make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode support wasn't just technical - it was about serving the world, not just English speakers. Same with timezones, internationalization features. When leadership reflects our diversity, we build technology that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all else, do you know how old Python is this year? It's 34 years! How can a programming language stay this strong after all these years? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right: Acknowledge diverse needs and implement them, to stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's An Opportunity Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using the word "opportunity" several times when I talked about diversity, equity and inclusion. There is a reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending years talking to and working with our community in this region, my mind has changed: So you see, our region is diverse, we speak over 1000 languages in South East Asia alone. All of you look different, and you speak different languages. Only two countries or territories within this region establish English as a legally official language.&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of framing it as a diversity problem, what I realized is that it's an &lt;strong&gt;opportunity problem&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not have enough opportunities to go around to different people in our community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing though: Opportunity here can mean different things to different people: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people just do not have the financial capabilities to get a computer to learn programming, or do not have enough money to go participate in conferences to meet new people and learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others might just not know the right people to get them started in joining a community which they are interested in, and contribute with their leadership skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us need access to affordable childcare to be able to participate in conferences, workshops or sprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ALL of us need a support system – a network of encouragement and accountability – to stay motivated and overcome challenges in pursuing our goals for the community. All of us need the opportunity to connect, share, give and receive help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Someone Is Doing It, Until No One Does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many PyCons have you been to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know three people who organize meetups or contribute to Python projects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: This conference didn't just happen. Someone made it happen. Someone figured out the money, the logistics, overcame the fear and doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it's here because YOU are here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in our region, we have a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough people know the right people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough connections to funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough role models to follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough people who care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? More people burn out than join in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that happens, communities die. And we lose all those opportunities to grow and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about this a lot when I decided to run for a PSF board seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a better way. We need to support our contributors, give them resources, and create opportunities for everyone to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it gets done when &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; does it, until no one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing the Python Asia Organization a.k.a PAO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I publicly proposed the idea for the Python Asia Organization or PAO for short, was during my keynote for PyCon APAC 2022 hosted by our friends in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through a public comments process with our community, we finally oficially created PAO for in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of you have heard of PAO before coming here, today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why PAO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is PAO's mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Python Asia Organization is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse regional community of Python programmers within the East and Southeast Asia region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who PAO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We officially launched on June 16, 2024, in Tokyo, with founding members Kwon Han Bae from PyCon KR, Manabu Terada from PyCon JP, myself, and Freilla Mae Espinola from PyCon PH who serves as our Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How PAO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAO has four main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Empowering Our Local Events:&lt;/strong&gt; We want to make it easier for organizers across Asia to run fantastic Python events. We'll provide financial support, create structured programs to reduce the workload, and share what we learn so everyone can benefit. Think of it as a way to lighten the load and build on each other's successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Growing Our Leaders:&lt;/strong&gt;  We need more people stepping up to lead within our community. We’re committed to supporting them. We’ll be a resource for guidance, spread leadership responsibilities, and create focused groups – similar to how the Python Software Foundation works – to tackle specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Connecting with the World:&lt;/strong&gt;  We want to help our community shine on a global stage. We’re here to support people attending international conferences, encourage nominations for awards, and act as a bridge between our region and other vital Python organizations like the Black Python Devs group, Python Software Foundation and  EuroPython Society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. IP and infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; To be the owner of intellectual property and infrastructure for regional community use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safe Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAO wants to create safe spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyana Phelps talks about finding her safe space in Djangonauts that allowed her to be a speaker and contribute to our community during PyCon US 2025 D&amp;amp;I Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does a safe space look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, think PyLadies groups where in a predominantly male industry, women feel comfortable asking questions, or Django Girls workshops where beginners build their first apps, learning from mistakes, in a supportive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But safe spaces are about more than just gender. They're about inclusivity. It’s about feeling comfortable explaining things in your own language, not feeling pressured to have the newest equipment, and being respected for how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; communicate, even if that's in a quiet way or indirect.  Here, in our region, that means being mindful of time zones, celebrating our cultures with food, and valuing everyone, regardless of their English proficiency.  Ultimately, a safe space is where we can all be ourselves, learn, and grow together as Pythonistas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone of us will eventually move on. The PyCon SG community especially understands this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community work is like a candle: We burn ourselves out for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, our conference organizers start from scratch. New country, same problems - figuring out ticketing, travel grants, finding speakers. We keep reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we didn't have to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lynn Root said at PyCon US 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our legacy is measured by our pure presence, in the joy that we create, and the connections that we foster, and the play that we dare embrace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what we want - more joy, less stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So PAO is building a playbook. Not just for PythonAsia, but for any Python conference in Asia. We're documenting everything - how to find sponsors, how to handle visas, how to build a great program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're creating mentorship programs where experienced organizers help newcomers. We're building shared resources - speakers, translators, design assets - that everyone can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we're keeping relationships alive. When someone burns out or moves on, their knowledge stays with PAO. The next person doesn't start from zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this work, we're paying our Executive Director. Because sustainable community work needs sustainable support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how we build something that lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Luck, Fate And Gut Feeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first PyCon and my interaction with the wider community was at the first PyCon APAC right here in Singapore in June 2010. While I was writing this keynote, I reflected on the fact I was here &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; 15 years ago and realized the significance of me standing in front of all of you today within the context of my history working with our community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, Mark Hammond (received the DSA in 2015 for his work on Win32), Wesley Chun (Chan) and Steve Holden was our keynote speakers. It was all new to me: The culture of sharing and camradarie between Pythonistas. I didn't realize that a programming conference can be so much fun and people so kind to an introvert and beginner like me! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time my gut feeling was that I felt like I wanted to help out a little with this community, not much I guess because, hey, what do I know about community building? And maybe if I'm lucky enough, learn a few new things and make a few friends along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, look at where we are now! I was lucky to be given the opportunity to work with so many like-minded and kind people along the way and It looks like fate has brought me come full circle on what I sarted with and what I am trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, it's really unbelievable, because a few years ago I decided to pick up a motto that’s inspired by the Japanese women curling Olympic medalist, Yoshida Chinami. She said in one of her interviews that she lives her life by luck, fate and gut feeling. Or in Japanese we say it as &lt;strong&gt;運と縁と勘で生きてる&lt;/strong&gt;. When I first read that interview of her, I was blown away. That's it! It's a simple truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now standing here, looking back on the past 15 years, it really feels that way: I followed my gut feeling to learn Python and contribute to the community, and I'm incredibly lucky for the wonderful people I've and supported me along the way. Those experiences have shaped my journey, and now fate has brought me in front all of you – at the place where it all began – to talk about our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I live my life on luck, fate and gut feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Join Us And Support Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting more people the opportunity to have that gut feeling, being lucky and connected in fate within our community to grow and learn is what I hope PAO will do. I hope one day, someone will experience something similar and bring themselves full circle, contributing and growing with it like I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I end my keynote, I want to say thank you to our corporate Starter Sponsors, and our Github Sponsors that have believed in what we're trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope that all of you who are here today will also join us, and support us, to build a sustainable community for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Iqbal Abdullah, and thank you for having me here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides delivering my keynote, I also helped raise funds by staffing our PAO booth during the conference. I attended a workshop on the third day, which provided an introduction to data handling and machine learning, facilitated by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/en-hao-tew/"&gt;En Hao Tew&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Gi and conference chair &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-wee-teh-963b9726a/"&gt;Kim Wee&lt;/a&gt; were wonderful hosts. Singapore is always a fantastic location for PyCon.
Thank you for having me! I look forward to seeing you again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that on November 13, 2024, the PSF board approved a resolution to award me the &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/"&gt;PSF Community Service Award&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the 2024 Q4 Community Service Award to Iqbal Abdullah for contributions to the Python community in the Asia-Pacific region, including PyCon Malaysia, PyCon APAC, and PyCon Japan, as well as contributions to multiple PSF workgroups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasant surprise on that cool fall morning. I feel happy and proud that my peers nominated me, and that the work we've done over the years was recognized. It was unfortunate that I could not be at PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh to personally receive the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was received on my behalf by Freilla Espinola during PyCon US, and Terada Manabu brought it back to Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Iqbal Receiving the PSF Community Service Award for Contributions to the Python Community" src="https://iqbalabdullah.net/images/psf-python-community-service-award.png"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was unfortunate that I couldn’t meet my fellow recipients, friends, and receive the award in person during PyCon US this time, it was meaningful to receive the award from the people that I started my community and Python work with. The people pictured above are also past recipients of the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, looking at the people who have received the award in the past, I don't think I deserve it. I don't think the things I have done in my community are as impactful or as difficult as theirs. I couldn't have done it alone either, and many people did it with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in the past, some friends have confided in me that they don't think they deserve this or that award or recognition because they think their work wasn't significant enough. I didn't quite understand them at that time because I thought they did good work and totally deserved it. So I usually just say something like this to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The wonderful thing is, this isn't something for you to decide. We (the community) are the ones deciding, so don't sweat it. Please accept the gift."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think I understand how they feel. So with a thank you, I will happily accept this gift and not sweat it. It is an
honour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nominate Your Friends!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately 10.1 million Python developers worldwide. Around 22% of them are in Europe, and another 16% are in the United States. China, India, and Japan combined account for 52%. Nearly 19% of all Python developers are women.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I’m extrapolating from the data, of course, but it’s something for us to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the award was initiated in March 2008, a total of 127 people have received it.
I am the sixth person in Japan, the first Malaysian, and the tenth person within East, South East, and South Asia to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2021, five people representing the PyCon JP Association received the award for their fundraising efforts for the PSF. Before that, in December 2020, Georgi Kerr was awarded for her PyLadies, D&amp;amp;I, PyCon TH, and PyCon APAC work. In September 2018, Mariatta, who is based in Canada but originated from Indonesia, received the award for her contribution to CPython and diversity efforts within the community. Before Mariatta, the award was given to Kenneth Gonsalves of India in October 2012 posthumously for his community work in India, and the first recipient of the award within our region was Noufal Ibrahim (also India) in October 2009 for his work organizing the inaugural PyCon India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the ten people within our region receiving the award, two are women, and the rest are men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many of us here that I’m pretty sure you know someone around you who has done or is doing great work but isn’t acknowledged or recognized. So just go ahead and &lt;a href="https://iqbalabdullah.net/posts/2024/05/nominating-pythonistas-at-the-psf/"&gt;nominate them for stuff!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After 15 years, the community has chosen to retire the name "PyCon APAC" and embark on a new journey for Python conferences in Asia. This change isn't just about rebranding; it's about creating a more sustainable and structured future for the Python community across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference wrapped up on March 2, 2025. Traditionally, we announce the next hosts at the end of each event. The PH organizers graciously gave me a few minutes during the closing to address the audience and fill in the "who's next" portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The End of "PyCon APAC"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2010/04/pycon-apac-early-bird-and-tutorial.html"&gt;PyCon APAC began in 2010 in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the efforts of Beng Keat, Maurice Ling, and the dedicated Pythonistas in Singapore. Their goal was to unite Python enthusiasts across the region, bringing PyCon to Asia to make it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the conference rotated among eight host countries, fostering friendships and proving that Python is more than just a programming language. It's a community. Brett Cannon's famous quote captures it best: "I came for the language, but I stayed for the community."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the event grew, so did the challenges. The term "APAC" often required explanation to global audiences. More critically, each year's host had to rebuild everything from scratch—securing sponsorships, navigating permissions, and handling logistics—leading to inefficiencies and the loss of institutional knowledge. Organizer burnout became an all-too-common reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these issues, we made a pivotal decision: &lt;strong&gt;PyCon APAC needs to evolve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Python Asia Organization (PAO)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The directors and members of the Python Asia Organization (PAO)" src="https://iqbalabdullah.net/images/pycons/pao-directors-pycon-apac-2025.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The members and directors of the Python Asia Organization posing on stage before their talk (L to R: Kwon Han Bae,
Freilla Espinola, Manabu Terada, Iqbal Abdullah)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure sustainability and continuity, we established the &lt;a href="https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/80644409/Python-Asia-Organization-MT%C3%9C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python Asia Organization (PAO)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new nonprofit will oversee regional Python conferences in Asia, holding intellectual property rights, managing trademarks, and most importantly, providing long-term structural support for future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have considered something like PAO since &lt;a href="https://iqbalabdullah.net/posts/2020/06/diversification-is-the-future-for-the-psf/"&gt;running for a PSF board seat in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, noticing the lack of representation from our side of the world—often due to indifference or even not knowing the PSF exists. After discussing informally with my community members, I formally announced my idea for PAO at the end of my &lt;a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2022/en-us/conference/keynotes/"&gt;keynote during PyCon APAC 2022&lt;/a&gt; hosted by our TW friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me be clear: &lt;strong&gt;PAO is not an umbrella organization representing all Asian Python communities.&lt;/strong&gt; Each country and community remains independent. PAO serves as a hub to facilitate collaboration, empower community leaders, share resources, and ensure that future Python conferences in Asia no longer have to start from scratch each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;new name&lt;/strong&gt; for the conference will be chosen, with an official announcement by &lt;strong&gt;April 10, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAO will take over trademarks and intellectual property&lt;/strong&gt;, giving the community independent ownership over its conference brand. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance changes will be tested&lt;/strong&gt; with the 2026 conference.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2026 host selection will shift from proposals to a structured assignment process&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring smoother transitions and better planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host country for 2026 is yet to be decided. One of the biggest shifts we are considering is moving away from the traditional call-for-proposals model and instead &lt;strong&gt;designating hosts&lt;/strong&gt; through a structured selection process. This change will allow PAO to work closely with the host country for 2026, to consolidate learnings from that process and ensuring a seamless transition from one conference to the next from 2027 where we hope to resume the call-for-proposals model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledging Our Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exciting as this new phase is, it doesn't come without challenges. Every PyCon APAC host in the past has faced hurdles securing sponsorships, managing logistics, and navigating local regulations. Despite tremendous effort, much of that knowledge was lost when a new host took over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With PAO, we are determined to change that. &lt;strong&gt;Standardized processes, shared knowledge, and a more structured support&lt;/strong&gt; will ease the burden on future hosts. More importantly, we want to ensure that Python conferences in Asia &lt;strong&gt;continue to thrive, grow, and bring people together for years to come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking Back, Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bittersweet moment as I stood on stage for the final PyCon APAC closing in Manila. This wasn't just a conference; it was the culmination of years of passion, dedication, and collaboration among people from many countries. Only a few in the audience had attended a PyCon APAC conference before, so I briefly recapped its history, explained what's changing, and shared our plans. I also mentioned that this might be the last time we use "PyCon APAC", and we do not yet know who the next hosts will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't the end. It's the beginning of something even greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite all of you to join this next chapter. We need your voices, your ideas, and your passion to build something that will last for the next generation of Pythonistas in Asia. I also want acknowledge and say thank you to other community partners such as &lt;a href="https://blackpythondevs.com"&gt;Black Python Devs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.europython-society.org/europython/"&gt;Euro Python Society of EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; for being such great examples we can follow that also pushes us forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of PyCon APAC isn't disappearing; it's evolving and growing into something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to the future of Python in Asia. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I want to acknowledge and thank my comrade-in-arms, Manabu Terada, for his public gratitude about my role in managing PyCon APAC over the past ten-or-so years. All of us contributed just as much as the rest of us.
P.S.S Thank you to Freilla for reviewing this post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2025"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="asia"></category><category term="pycon"></category><category term="ph"></category></entry></feed>
