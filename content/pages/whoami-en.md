My latest enterprise is [LaLoka Labs](https://lalokalabs.co/en/). We build software with the hope of making people happier human beings. LaLoka Labs is also my platform to experiment with things which I find interesting.

I am also the founder and director for [Xoxzo Inc.](https://info.xoxzo.com/) which provides a 
simple web API platform for telephony services. After 14 years of running the business, in October 2021, [I sold a 67% stake in Xoxzo to Accrete Inc.](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2021/09/16/accrete-acquiring-xoxzo/). Consequently, I divested all my shares in Xoxzo in January 2024.

I am a business founder, a software engineer, founder and co-founder of [PyCon JP](https://pycon.jp/) 
and [PyCon MY](https://pycon.my/).

I am originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and have been a resident of Japan since 1997. I graduated from the Engineering Faculty, of Saga University.
I am currently residing in Nerima-ku, Tokyo.

I use git, practice design patterns and unit tests heavily.

Previously I worked for [Yahoo Japan, Inc.](http://docs.yahoo.co.jp/info/company/) as a software engineer and [Amazon
Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/) as a marketing manager.

I believe in 

* globalisation
* capitalism
* The ability of humans to think and work together for a common goal
* differences of opinions
* one way of writing code in Python
* reading as a substitute for travelling
* the inherent responsibility of humans to do good for this world
* Art as a filter to our consciousness
* giving and contributing back
* and sometimes all that I believe in above doesn't work out well so I need to figure something else out.
