Summary: Being CEO is a maximizing your balancing act and not a zero-sum game

On my flight on Singapore Airlines from Changi to KLIA I read an interesting
interview of [Tan Suee Chieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Suee_Chieh) in The Straits Times Opinion section (Fri Oct 19
2012 edition).

In that interview, Tan talks about going "from well to good", and how this is a departure from how he usually did things before going on board as head of Singapore's NTUC.

I find this excerpt of the interview particularly interesting:

> "I worked in commercial companies for 25 years. My job as CEO of a listed
> company has always been to maximise profits. And my obligation is to give as
> little as possible to the customer, subject to market share and profit
> considerations. But my job at NTUC Income is to give as much as possible to the
> policyholders as a group. It's two different mindsets."

Of course, as an outfit out to make a profit everything is subject to profit considerations. But I feel that being CEO or the leader even for an unlisted, 3-person family business, with obligations to *give as little as possible to the customer* while in the same stride talking about *maximising profits* is misguided at best.

Is this how our Asian CEOs in this part of the world generally think what their mandate is all about?

In my role as a leader, in a nutshell, my work boils down to:

* Give good returns to shareholders by maximizing profits, as they are the ones taking the risk to put up the money for the business in the first place.
* Stand in the customer's shoes and give them as much as possible making them happy, which will get you more money to do point 1 above. You are where you are because your customers are. 
* Empower your employees and then stand out of their way so that they can please your customer which will lead to point 2 above and consequently to point 1.

It should not be (and it never is) a zero-sum game. Maximising profits does not mean giving as little as possible to your customer.
