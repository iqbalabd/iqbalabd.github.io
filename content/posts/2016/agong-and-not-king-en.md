Summary: Malaysians do not have a king, but the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

This was an email I sent to The Star on referring to the Malaysian Head of State
using the appropriate proper noun. It was not published.

> I refer to your news article on 16th Nov 2016 with the title
> [King and Queen attend parade of thanks for 14th Yang di-Pertuan
> Agong](http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/11/16/king-and-queen-attend-parade-of-thanks-for-14th-yang-dipertuan-agong/)
> 
> Every time I read in your paper news about our Yang di-Pertuan Agong
> and your paper refers to him as King and his consort as Queen, I
> cringe.
> 
> We Malaysians do not have a king. Spain has a king. Sweden has a king.
> Monaco has a king. Japan has an emperor, while we Malaysian have our
> Agong.
> 
> It is a unique position even within this small world of ours. A king
> generally implies a hereditary line of monarchs with power passed down
> between families. Our Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected and even has a
> deputy which are not from the same family unlike kings which have
> crown princes which are nearly the time sons of the same family.
> 
> Our passports also refers to the Agong as "His Majesty the Yang
> di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia".
> 
> The Agong is not a hereditary role, is a proper noun and referring to
> a specific and important role in our country. There is no equivalent
> english translation for our Agong, as the English language came from a
> region and time where a ruler is a king and have absolute powers.
> 
> As an alternative, you can refer to our Agong by addressing him by
> "His Majesty" and his consort as "Her Majesty", or even the "Supreme
> Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces" if you'd like.
> 
> As one of the few English papers with wide circulation in the country,
> we can assume that your good paper will be read by many foreigners
> visiting our shores. It would be best to give the proper introduction
> to them concerning our Yang di-Pertuan Agong, by correctly referring
> to our unique elected Head of State lest they'l have the impression
> that the Federation of Malaysia have "kings".
