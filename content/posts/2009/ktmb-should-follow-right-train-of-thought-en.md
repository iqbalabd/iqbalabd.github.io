Summary: Why KTMB still in the red

This was an [email](http://bit.ly/TxHZCy) I sent to The Star on Christmas Day 2009 about how terrible
KTMB Komuter service was. I was pretty pissed at that time. I don't understand
how KTMB cannot understand this very simple thing on providing a decent service to
it's customers.

After I sent the email, I got a call from The Star while I was in Jaya Jusco in
Malacca and the person wanted to confirm that what I wrote about KTMB's aim of
getting MYR1 profit was correct before they published it.

> ON DEC 12, I took KTM’s Ekspres Sinaran Pagi from KL Sentral bound for
> Singapore, which was originally scheduled to depart at 8.30am.
> 
> While I waited at the terminal, the departure time was rescheduled to 8.40am
> and again to 8.55am. The train finally departed at 9am, and we reached
> Singapore one hour later than the scheduled time.
> 
> For the KTM Komuter from Mid Valley to Seremban (Rawang-Seremban route) on
> Dec 22, we waited from 9.10pm and the train arrived only at 9.40pm. We
> finally reached Seremban at around 11pm.
> 
> KTMB customers waiting at the Mid Valley station resigned themselves to the
> waiting, and some even opened up their work on the cement floor and tried to
> get something done.
> 
> The electronic signs at the platform were confusing and did not show correct
> information. We were not notified the reason for the delays.
> 
> Certain passengers were inconsiderate, refusing to allow passengers to alight
> first before boarding, pushing ahead with their big backpacks, having their
> handphone ringtones on full volume and refusing to give up their seats for a
> blind mother and child who boarded in Serdang.
> 
> The experience of taking the Komuter from Mid Valley to Seremban has left me
> tired. I felt I have grown older by 10 years and my will to live has gone.
> 
> There are two points that I wish to share with KTMB:
> 
>    1. In today’s economy, KTMB must realise that it is not an operator of
>       railways. It must realise that it is a service provider, not much different
>       from taxis or retail outlets. It just so happens that the service provider
>       called KTMB is providing its service through railways.
> 
>    1. The money is in transporting people, not goods. If KTMB truly wishes to
>    reach its stated target of even RM1 profit, stay there or even go beyond
>    that, it has to understand that the service of transporting people, in a
>    timely and comfortable manner, will be the single most important revenue
>    provider.
> 
> These are important concepts that everyone in KTMB must realise and
> understand, from the CEO down to the person maintaining the ticket machines
> at the stations.
> 
> From a layman’s point of view KTMB has great potential.
> 
> With highways being built every day and airline flights getting cheaper, it
> is more important than ever that KTMB realise its potential as a service
> provider, and the strength that its assets hold. KTMB owns tracks and
> stations which are not affected by traffic yet that go direct to the heart of
> towns.
> 
> Malaysia will change like other developed nations, where more and more people
> commute to work from out-of-state into Kuala Lumpur. We see this happening
> right here and now, and it is inevitable.
> 
> There are too many cars on the roads and everyone is tired of traffic jams in
> the city.
> 
> Everything is in place that will allow KTMB to be the leading transportation
> service provider. All that KTMB needs to do is to leverage these assets and
> by being reliable and punctual.
> 
> To be reliable and on time do not require KTMB to change its rolling stock
> immediately, nor does it require it to send its staff to Tokyo to study how
> JR (Japan Railways Group) does its job. All KTMB has to do is ride its own
> trains and make notes of what it’s doing right and what it’s doing wrong, and
> then fix them.
