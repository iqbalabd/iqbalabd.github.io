Summary: Thinking back on what I've done through PyCon and how it all started in the first place.

# Changing the world one PyCon at a time

As an engineer, programming languages are very important tools to solve the
problems that you face. As an entrepreneur, they are also important tools to
bring your imagination to life, to get that profit and make that difference.

Python is a magnificent programming language. Although first released in 1991, it _arguably_
only started to become mainstream[^fn01] when
[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), the creator of
Python joined Google in 2005. That made many people start to notice how serious
the tech giant was investing in Python. In the same year, the web framework
Django which is written in Python was released, and that further pushed Python into the limelight.

Now, even our very much loved
[Instagram uses Python](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/) 
to handle its hundreds of millions of requests. Python is also used in
scientific and academic fields

I have been using Python since 2002, and in many ways, it has given me the
intellectual challenge I craved, allowed me the freedom to bring my imagination
to life, and PyCon, has allowed me to meet wonderful people.

## My First PyCon, APAC 2010 in Singapore

But a programming language is only as good as the people who use it.

[PyCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Conference) is, in essence, a conference
centred around the Python programming language. Its roots started with the first PyCon in
Washington D.C in 2003 and has expanded to many parts of the world, from Europe, Japan,
China, India, HK, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and also Malaysia.

Up until 2010, before attending my first PyCon, I had been using Python for fun
and profit for 8 years. I find the language easy to use, has a design that fits
with my mind and how I believe coding should be, and most importantly I enjoyed using
it to build stuff.

So when I saw the poster for the first PyCon APAC in Singapore in 2010, I
decided to meet the people behind it:

![PyCon APAC 2010 Singapore]({static}/images/pycons/pycon-apac-2010-poster.png)

I didn't know anyone there but I thought I'd just make new friends and see
what other cool stuff everyone else was building. And made friends I did: I met up with
three other participants from Japan: Manabu Terada
([@terapyon](https://twitter.com/terapyon?lang=en)),
Yasuhi Masuda([@whosaysni](https://twitter.com/whosaysni?lang=en)) and Ian
Lewis([@ianmlewis](https://twitter.com/ianmlewis?lang=en)).

As it turns out, the chairperson for the first PyCon APAC in Singapore was Liew Beng Keat
([@bengkeatliew](https://twitter.com/bengkeatliew)) a Malaysian from Kuala
Lumpur. We have more in common than I thought!

## Bringing PyCon to the region

It was then that Beng Keat was telling me the reason he wanted to organize a
regional version of PyCon APAC: Beng Keat had the opportunity to attend PyCon in
the United States, and although he enjoyed the conference and came back enlightened,
he also realized how prohibitive it is to travel from Asia to the United States
and so he thought: _If we can't go to PyCon in the US, we'll bring
PyCon here._ And since Singapore was such a small place, it makes more sense to
make it a regional conference instead of just a local conference.

The concept of having a regional PyCon is in essence a very simple one, with a
well defined purpose: We understand that nearly all of the advances made in
technology by the programming language, new concepts and philosophy in thinking about the
language and even how communities are organized towards the greater good for
everyone at large originates mostly in the United States and Europe.

If we cannot be in the United States to meet and listen to the great minds that shape
the programming language, its community and its future, let us have those minds
here instead.

And at that first APAC PyCon in Singapore, one of the keynote speakers was [Steve
Holden](https://github.com/holdenweb), who was the chairman for PSF[^fn02], 
who later on was a pivotal figure in the growth of PyCon within APAC.

### Building the Japan PyCon community, circa 2011

We invited Steve to come to Tokyo after APAC, and over dinner, we talked about
having an annual conference to get Pythonistas from all over the country to come
and share their work and discuss their ideas. Steve was instrumental in providing
us, who had no experience at all running conferences, to take the idea
seriously. Given the fact that Python was still considered an obscure
language in Japan as opposed to PHP, Java or Ruby, we were also sceptical that
there would be any traction at all.

**With Masuda-san and Takizawa-san**

Following that dinner with Steve, Terada-san, Masuda-san and I met again on the
1st of July 2010 in an underground Turkish restaurant in Shibuya and over dinner decided
to have our first stab at a PyCon in Japan. We agreed to start small, and host
APAC when we are ready.

![Email calling for the first PyCon meeting]({static}/images/pycons/shibuya-email.png)

We had our first [_mini_ PyCon JP](https://sites.google.com/site/pyconminijp/) 
on a cold January morning in 2011 at the Rakuten offices in Tokyo. I was 
involved as the program manager, choosing talks and deciding the contents of the conference.
130 people came for the mini-conference, and we all had a great time listening
to talks, learning and making new friends. The conference was free, and everyone
had bento for lunch provided by our generous sponsors.

Encouraged by the turnout and how the first conference went, we then decided to
have a major PyCon JP for the first time in the summer of 2011.

PyCon JP has been held every year around summer since then and in 2016 our
attendees topped 700 people.

Back to 2012: An issue that we faced after the second PyCon in 2012 was that it was getting
too big, and the leftover money from sponsors was getting too much to handle
out from an individual account. We also needed a face for the public and a
definite entity that will take responsibility for managing the annual conference
in Japan. 

Because of that, the non-profit PyCon JP was established in March 2013, and I
am still currently serving as part of the board members.

To prepare to host APAC, since 2012 we needed to give an international flavour for the
conference, and we made it a point to have at least one track which will be in
English only. This has attracted participation from nearby countries, such as
South Korea and Taiwan.

To also attract interest from the public, and because our
non-profit run on money gained from public interests, we also made it a point to
have an open non-profit general meeting during the local PyCons. It is here
where we met other people who are thinking or are interested in running their
own PyCons.

### PyCon APAC in Japan, 2013

Singapore has been organizing the APAC conference for 3 years in a row since
2010, and following the model of PyCon US of moving the venue to different cities
every two years, 2013 they approached us in Japan to take over APAC and organize
it is in Japan.

We have been preparing for this since 2011, so we agreed. Our Taiwan counterpart
was also keen on running APAC, but after discussions they agreed to bid for
2014 instead. 

This was good for us in the region on 2 accounts:

- The regional conference APAC has finally moved away from Singapore to a
  different city
- We have another host decided for 2014.

So in August 2013, we organized PyCon APAC in Shinjuku, Tokyo, and that is where
we met all the many people who will spread PyCon across the region.

## The Asia Pacific Connection

Regionally, we have a loosely knit community that drives PyCon APAC
(Asia Pacific). Ideally, PyCon APAC is a regional conference that rotates
between cities within the APAC region, and aims to be an international
and bigger conference allowing the regional python
community to come together at a more accessible and affordable location compared to
having to travel to the United States or Europe.

After the APAC conference in Tokyo in 2013, there was consensus from the regional
community representatives such as Singapore and South Korea which we managed to
get in touch with when they came to APAC in Tokyo, to move the APAC conference to Taipei.

Since there was no other community which has shown interest in hosting APAC for
2015, the conference stayed in Taipi until 2015.

The South Korean community, after having their first local PyCon in
2015 stepped up to the plate to host APAC in 2016 and was successful with over 1000 attendees.

**Group picture after the community meeting**

The regional communities have done a wonderful job of boosting their local PyCon
conferences to be a well-known annual event to gather and share knowledge among
their Python users. The regional APAC conferences have also proved to be a platform where new community leaders from neighbouring countries come to connect
and learn how to organize their own local PyCons.

We make it a point to reach out to fellow community members from countries which up until now
have no representation in our loose groups, like Myanmar or Vietnam.  I've seen fellow Pythonistas
who came to a PyCon APAC for the first time, and their eyes light up and they smile and say
now they want to start something in their city and their community after
experiencing the conference.

**Meeting up with Dylan Jay in Bangkok. Dylan is the former lead for the Sydney
Python Users Group**

The collective knowledge of all of us helps to remove some anxiety and helps guide
them on what are the points that they'll need to keep in mind to start something
for their city, from organizing know-how to even getting sponsorship
funding. The PSF in this regard has been supportive in providing grants and
also speakers at the APAC conferences.

### Connecting Pythonistas in Malaysia

After helping out with running PyCon in Japan, I realized that all the PyCons
that we had in the APAC region has all been on the north-eastern part of Asia
Pacific, except Singapore, but all of them were either cost or time
prohibitive to the rest of Asia Pacific.

And that begins my next project: To kickstart an annual PyCon in Malaysia grown
for the locals, from the locals, and bring APAC and the rest of the world to Kuala Lumpur.

I aim to have an APAC conference here in Kuala Lumpur as I believe, compared
to the north-east of Asia Pacific, a conference here will be more accessible to
much more people.

_If we can't go to PyCon, we'll get PyCon here._

In Malaysia, the history of PyCon started in 2014 when we had our
first mini PyCon (1 day, single track and 70 people attended) and
continued with PyCon MY 2015 (2 days, 2 tracks and around 140 people
attended) and PyCon MY 2016 (2 days, 2 tracks and around 100 people
attended). I was involved as the co-chair and finance person for the mini
PyCon 2014, the chair for PyCon MY 2015, and co-chair again in 2016.

You can read more about us at [https://pycon.my/](https://pycon.my/)

But before we start running an international conference like the APAC, we need
to know _how_ to at least run a conference. Having local experienced people to organise
conferences will also allow us to convince the other regional members that we
are up to the job.

In 2014 there was already a loose group of Python users, who had meetups once every
2 or 3 months mainly around the Kuala Lumpur area, usually attended by more or less 10 people.
As is common for any non-profit, grass-roots volunteer-driven small meetups with no
monetary or marketing support from commercial entities, these meetups were mostly
attended by the same group of people and before long you'll have organizers burning out,
running out of steam and also things to talk about.

The de-facto organizer for these meetups then was Swee Meng, and I met him for the first
time at one of Singapore's PyCon. When I suggested to him an annual PyCon for Malaysia,
he was sceptical at first, given his bitter experience with user meetups. He was not convinced
that people would come, but I told him that that was beside the point. If only 10 or
20 people come, so be it. That will be our Malaysian PyCon. Either way, it goes,
that will be our learning experience, and we'll see where that leads us.

Since our first mini PyCon in 2014, many people have helped us, especially the
kind generosity of venue providers, like iTrain, University Malaya and
International University of Malaya-Wales. Nearly all the time we've had help
from the academic staff of the universities who use Python as a learning tool
and wanted their students to get involved in academic conferences like
PyCon.

**And the group picture at the end of PyCon MY 2016.**

As if coming to a full circle, one of the keynote speakers for the first APAC in
Singapore in 2010 (Steve Holden), and another keynote speaker for the first PyCon JP in 2011
([Tarek Ziadé](https://ziade.org/resume.html), who works remotely in the bushes of Dijon, for Mozilla)
was our keynote speaker in 2016.

I am happy to report that Tarek enjoyed his first-ever durian here in Kuala Lumpur when keynoting for us.

Following the model that we did in Japan, we have also set up a [partnership](https://pycon.my/about/pycon-my-plt/)
in Malaysia to facilitate managing funds and also as a public-facing entity to be
responsible for managing PyCon in Malaysia.

#### The local sponsors

Our local sponsors who have supported us until now are mostly small companies with
personal relations to one of the members of the staff, that uses Python in their
products or day-to-day operations. These companies are the most generous. They
do not sponsor large amounts, but they are always ready
to give a helping hand. I believe they are the ones who truly understand
and appreciate how difficult it is to organize such a conference and the value
that it will bring to them and the community.

For our 1st local PyCon, we did have big-name companies that sponsored us, like
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) a 
subsidiary of PayPal. However, the young and still inexperienced Python crowd in Malaysia
might not be a compelling reason yet for them to continue sponsoring.

## PyCon APAC in Kuala Lumpur

For 2017, after proposing the APAC community, we have been
selected to hold the responsibility of having PyCon APAC 2017 in Kuala Lumpur,
which will be held in August.

What I would like to take the opportunity to highlight here is the
wonderful work the community has done to bring PyCon APAC 2017, from
universities, student volunteers, local companies and most of all the
people that make up the community itself.

Personally in the Malaysian context, I believe we need more makers or
programmers in our ecosystem. I feel that we focus too much on the
business side of things, with "business-focused" conferences like
match-making or raising venture capital. But these are all moot without the
actual people and know-how to build what we want to sell. PyCon MY is
that small ripple we're making to have a positive contribution to the
overall builders and programming ecosystem.

With the title of being a regional conference, we now have the clout to invite
successful technology practitioners from overseas to give talks and share their
insights and ideas with the local crowd. This will hopefully spark interest and motivate
them to further improve their skills and knowledge.

## Changing the world one PyCon at a time

Through PyCon, the community also tries to practice common ground principles
based on universally accepted ideas and ideals. All regional or local PyCons which request
grants from the PSF [are required to have a _Code Of Conduct_](http://pyfound.blogspot.jp/2012/12/psf-moves-to-require-code-of-conduct.html) that governs how the organizers manage the conference, _and_ 
also how the attendees behave and interact with one another during the conference.

These Code Of Conduct (CoC) reflects the values of the community and what they think
is important. Not all talks during PyCons are about programming, web frameworks
or libraries: Some of them are about the experiences of the speaker walking the
path to become a female developer in an industry widely regarded as male-dominated,
or the need to have more diversity and how it's achieved through free community
training programs.

Focused groups like PyLadies (a Python group focused on women),
DjangoCon (Conference focused on the Django framework) and SciPy
(Conference for the users of Python in academics and science
fields) also all contribute to these same ideas and ideals while adding more
spice to the already vibrant Python community. In all this PyCon is the general
conference that tries to cover many usages of Python.

Following the spirit of the community at large and the values and ideals that we
try to have, for APAC this year and for the first time in the history of PyCon in Malaysia,
we are trying a few new things, such as

- Financial Aid
- Tie up with Women Who Code (WHC)
- Having the conference at a commercial conference venue
- Reducing waste
- Subsidized ticketing

The Financial Aid, tie-up with WHC and subsidized ticketing all aim to increase
participation from underrepresented groups who could not have attended the
conference due to financial reasons, or also from female tech communities, which
historically have little participation in tech conferences locally.

So in a way, PyCons are not _only just_ a technical conference that you might
expect from practitioners of a certain technology: It's also sort of a social
movement. Although in PyCons you do have booths for companies the commercial
aspects are very much watered down (as opposed to RISE or Web Summit).

With the PyCon and its culture blooming in this part of the world, I
hope it will continue to be a place Pythonistas regardless of experience
continue to meet, exchange ideas, interact and grow.

In essence, the aim of a conference like a PyCon, similar to the experience museums
or art galleries offer is to enlighten you and transform you into a different person intellectually
from the person that you were before attending the conference. In the context of
conferences, this is mostly achieved from the human interaction that you've
achieved by listening to and discussing talks and interacting with other attendees.
These transformations do not have to be huge leaps. Knowledge transfers take
time and require us to work on the new information many times in our minds before we can fully
appreciate and understand it.

Changing the world starts here, by us, one good idea at a time and through one PyCon at a time.
