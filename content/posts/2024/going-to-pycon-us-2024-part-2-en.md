# Next Stop: PyCon US 2024 In Pittsburgh

## Taking The Amtrak

We checked in our bags which we don't have for the Shinkansen back home.

There were two events which I needed to be in May this year:

- [PyCon US 2024 in Pittsburgh](https://us.pycon.org/2024/) (From May 15th to May 19th)
- [Latitude59 in Tallinn](https://latitude59.ee) (From May 22nd to May 24th)

The problem with this is that both events are only a few days apart of each other but at totally two different places of the planet. 

## Booking Travel and Accommodations

### Flights

Because of these two places that I needed to go, I decided to take the [Round The World ticket from Star Alliance](https://roundtheworld.staralliance.com/staralliance/EN/round-the-world)
(also know as RTW) because I am an ANA member. It's actually _much_ better deal to take the RTW ticket compared to a multi city ticket, unless
you want to go down the route of building your own flight plan through low-cost airlines. Even then, if you travel
often, you might lose out on the Miles benefits if you take the multi low-cost airlines route.

_Tip: The RTW ticket allows you to change your flights (add, remove or change), but try not to do that. They will charge you USD150 for each
time_. If you _have to_ change though, it's pretty easy: Just send them an email and they will figure it out for you.

### Hotels

Afiza handles our accomodations when we travel. She has a membership with the Marriott group hotels and her membership level gives her useful perks when we stay.

What I can say is that prices of accomodation has at least doubled since a year ago, while the quality hasn't changed much and depends very much on the establishment that you stay at.

## Packing For The Trip

I've been doing multi month travels over multiple cities since 2013. Over the years, the amount that I pack has gone way down. When I started out, I called it _"Defensive Packing"_ where you get as many things as possible to handle all possibilities when you're travelling.

Now I have transitioned to _"Aggresive Packing"_ where you get only essentials for your comfort and try get anything else that you'd need along the way.

Your milage may vary but here's what I got:

### Essentials: Clothes

- When I travel, the amount of clothes I bring maxes out at 6 nights. This requires that I go to the laundry at least
  every 5 days. Hotel laundaries are **expensive** (unless you're in a particular hotel in Istanbul) so checking out a
  nearby laundry service when you book your accomodations will be helpful.
- Shoes

### Essentials: Travel Goods

- Protable bidet
- Water pot

### Essentials: Medication And Toileteries

### Essentials: Work Items

- Laptop and charger

### Others

- One-cup drip coffee
- Skipping rope
