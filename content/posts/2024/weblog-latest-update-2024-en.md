Summary: Updating this weblog for 2024 and my 5-year diary

# Weblog Update

I finally sat down and got to updating this weblog. I write a lot, but most of my writing is work related and they will
go teir respective blogs, i.e the [Kafkai blog](https://kafkai.com/en/blog/), [GetOTP blog](https://otp.dev/en/blog/) or [LaLoka Labs's blog](https://lalokalabs.co/en/blog/) and after all of that there wasn't enough
time for me to write things which are more personal in nature.

## Started By A 5 Year Diary

Afiza gave me a "5-year diary" present for my 47th birthday. She enjoyed writing things on it and nearly finished her
current diary. She was recommended to it by a friend, and now she has also recommended it to me. I've started spending 2
or 3 minutes at the end of my day everyday to write random things tha happened that day to it, and realized the urge to
write longer thoughts without thinking about work too much. That bought me around to updating this personal weblog. 

## Some Fixes

Well, no point in updating something without fixing things along the way, right?

### Categories

I realized after all the time I've spent writing, having a particular _Category_ that my posts needed to be in was in
fact restriciting my writing. I have always been a person that thinks from top to bottom. Categories help if I'm writing
for work because we _usually_ have an outcome we want to achieve and it gives me structure, but when it comes to
personal writing, this gets in the way.

So I have decided to just file all my posts under the year that they are written, and just use [**tags**](https://iqbalabdullah.net/tags.html) instead as a
loose form of categorization.

#### Non-translatable Categories in Pelican

Another thing is that sometimes I translate my posts to different languages and I'm using the [Pelican]() for this weblog.
Pelican does a great job at publishing the different languages through the [i8n_subsites plugin]() but I haven't found a
way to have the Categories (which are decided when you create directories) in Pelican translated. So just having them as
years doesn't require translation.

### New Domain

And finally, this weblog has a new domain. Just like the weblogs of the people I read frequently such as [Tarek Ziade](https://ziade.org/)
and [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) it just makes more sense to me to have a domain that reflects myself as
is on the internet.
