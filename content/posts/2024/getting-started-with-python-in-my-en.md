Summary: Tips and resources to start learning Python without spending (much) money if you're in Malaysia

# Python Is The Rage Now

I read [on the internet](https://x.com/reviewbyyasmin/status/1802258242342736212) people wanting to join Python and data science related courses initiated by the government-led agencies. They are mostly free (paid by the taxpayer) but space is limited. Some of these courses are even limited to those under 30 years old. 

Upskilling is not limited to only the young, and learning Python shouldn't require you to spend (much) money. You can even start right away.

Python is a versatile language that is being used _everywhere_, from powering the internet, to [developing AI applications](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter0/1) and even in [outer space](https://datatas.com/does-nasa-use-python/). A **big reason** why it is so popular and succesfull is that it is [open-source](https://github.com/python/cpython) and [free to download and use](https://www.python.org/downloads/) which reduces the hurdle for it to be used and improved by the public.

## Learning Python For Free

I picked up Python for the first time in 2002 (v1.5.2). I didn't spend a sen when I started learning it at that time, and so can you.

There are tons of online resources that you can access for free to start learning to program in Python and going through it all to decide which to try might just give you a headache.

I'm going to suggest a few resources here which I know are built from the **other reason** why Python is so big: It's community.

### Learn By Doing

I had things I wanted to do, such as automatically pulling data from a website or send SMS from my computer to my friend's phone. It's usually automating some manual task that I have. You will have something that  you want to do too. Spend a few minutes thinking about it, and start by looking at ways you can do it via Python. Actually getting your hands dirty is the _fastest way_ to lean Python.

These are some material which are free and will be useful.

-   Learn To Program. For Free: Al Sweigart's [Invent With Python](https://inventwithpython.com)
    I met Al for the first time during PyCon PH in 2018. Al writes a lot of books geared for beginners and being the wonderful human being he is, makes these learning material available for free. His book [Automate The Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) is especially useful to give you ideas on what you can build with Python. 


- Trey Hunner's [Python Morsels newsletter](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newsletter/) 
    I met Trey during PyCon US. Trey writes newsletters and [tips on X](https://x.com/treyhunner) about Python. His material might be intermediate level, but even if you don't understand the terms and concepts, it's a good idea to just skim through it to familiarize yourself on the technical language. 

### Learn By Listening

When you're learning a new natural language (spoken language), an effective way to quickly learn it is to just listen to people talking in that language. You won't understand the meaning of the words at first, but just getting a feel of the language and how it is expressed will help multiply your understanding when you actually practice it. It is the same for programming languages.

- Mike Kennedy's [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm)
    I met Mike for the first time during PyCon PH in 2024. Mike's podcast interviews people that work on Python or uses Python in many different ways.

### Learn Python Together

The next step is to motivate yourself to so you'll continue with your learning and up-skill yourself. 

After you've familiarize yourself with the syntax and the technical language, it's time to meet people. If you can find a person or a few people that you can get along with, it will be good motivation for you to carry on with your learning and reduces the chances that you'll give up after a few months.

The Python community is one of the most welcoming community I've known. Find one near you and get to know them.

- Meetups: Members of the community sometimes to meetups and get together to learn together. There's not many Python user groups in Malaysia, but there are some adjacent ones.
    - [Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning Malaysia User Group](https://tfugmy.peatix.com)
    - Women driven data analytics, data science, data engineering, and ML in data community [Wanita Data](https://x.com/WanitaData)
- PyCons: Python conferences are called PyCons. There are usually country level PyCons such as [PyCon MY (Malaysia)](https://pycon.my/), [PyCon ID (Indonesia)](https://pycon.id), [PyCon TH](https://th.pycon.org) and the biggest PyCon in the world, [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/). We also have regional PyCons such as [EuroPython](https://europython.eu) for Europe and [PyCon APAC](https://pycon.asia) for our Asia-Pacific region.
- Specific interest groups, such as the women-led [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/locations/) or [PyData](https://www.meetup.com/PyDataKL/) . Special interest groups like the PyLadies is especially important to give a safe-space for minorities within our community to learn. If you're a woman and find it daunting to join a male dominated Python event, then the PyLadies is for you.

Meetups are sometimes free but PyCons are mostly paid. Don't worry: A requirement for a PyCon is to have their ticket prices reasonable to the general public or they cannot call themselves "PyCon". Nearly all PyCons also have travel grants and free tickets which you can apply for, thanks to their wonderful sponsors.

## Happy Coding

Learning Python in Malaysia is accessible and affordable, thanks to many free resources and the supportive community. By leveraging online materials like Al Sweigart's books and Trey Hunner's newsletters, you can start learning without any financial burden. Engage with the community through meetups, user groups, and PyCons, It will not only enhance your learning experience but also provide motivation and support from like-minded individuals.

Python's versatility and widespread use in various industries make it a valuable skill to acquire. From my experience, consistency is the most important thing when learning Python (or anything new for that matter). It makes a lot of difference if you spend an hour a day for a month instead of 10 hours within three days. Get something working, and enjoy that feeling.

Happy coding, and may your Python journey be as rewarding as it is exciting!
